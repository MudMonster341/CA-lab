QUESTIONS

1.Write a MIPS program to take the value of 'N' from the user, find the sum of first "N" natural numbers and print the output

int i, sum = 0;
for (i=1; i <= N; i++)
   sum = sum + i

2.Write a MIPS program to compute the factorial of a whole number N, where assume N > 0

factorial=1;
   for(i=1; i<=N; i++)
   {
     factorial *= i;
   }

3. To read a number N from input and find if the number is odd or even. Display the result to the user.

4. To find the sum of the digits of a number N. Display the result to the user.

sum = 0;
while (N != 0)
{
      remainder = N % 10;
      sum       = sum + remainder;
      N         = N / 10;
}

5. Write the MIPS ALP for the high level code. Observe precedence and associativity rules.

   a  = a * b / c % d + e;
