Write MALP for the following

1. A main procedure calls procedures named sum, difference, product and quotient. 
All procedures (except main) takes two numbers (x, y) as input arguments and returns the 
sum (x + y), difference (x-y), product (x*y) and quotient (x/y) values to the main procedure. 
The result of each operation is displayed to the user.

 
2. Linear search using procedure
Input arguments to the procedure: Address of the array, total number of elements and search element
Return value(s): 0 (element not found) 
              1 (element found), index

3. Fibonacci series using procedures

fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,â€¦

void fibo(int n)
{
	int a=0,b=1,c,i;
	for(i=1;i<=n-2;i++)
	{
		c=a+b;
		printf("%d\n",c);
		a=b;
		b=c;
	}
}
